Particle Swarm Optimisation of Neural Networks in R

Very simple (i.e. unoptimized) neural networks that are optimized using particle swarm optmization. Currently, this is a very inefficient algorithm with no defined stopping criteria. It is an early experiment to explore the solution spaces for high dimensional neural networks.
